The Website IP Checker is a Python program that allows you to enter a website URL 
and check its IP address. This can be useful for troubleshooting network issues, 
or for verifying the identity of a website. The program uses the socket module in 
Python to perform DNS lookups and retrieve the IP address of the website.
